This repository runs github actions on a schedule as a way to aggregate San Francisco Bikeshare data. The main script can be found in the `R` folder and the github action is created inside of `.github/workflows/schedule-commit.yaml`.

I relied heavily on the following two great tutorials to get this system up and running and would highly recommend checking them out if you're interested in doing something similar.
